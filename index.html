    <h1>Work Space</h1>
    <p><em>Intuitive, healthy and comfortable
way to make your personal space and time enjoyable
</em></p>
</section>

<section data-transition="slide" id="esummary" style="text-align: left;">
  <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;">People spend a lot of time in front of their desks and computers. Their goals and purposes vary from working and create, to relax or being entertained. After a long time sitting and staring at the monitor people end up being tired even if sitting does not involves a lot of physical action. Besides, a posture that a person has while working on any task is not always healthy: it is hard to control your position while focusing on something important. General goals of the Work Space are  to know when users body needs to change a position before the user will even think about it, provide user with variety of positions that regular desks and chairs are not able to be set up.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;">
   The desk will recognize a user and keep track of their common habits of sitting, while comparing and determining how to provide better solution for positioning through posture and break alerts, timely summaries, suggestions and guidance. The user will be able easily change positions of their body, or setup or create a specific mode depending on the task they want to perform.
</p>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;">
   The concept of this smart workspace is created for solving common issues of emotional and physical tiredness and discomfort, eliminate health problems resulting from sitting in one position, and also to increase productivity, while providing a pleasant user experience. The main components that will be included in the concept and research are machine learning for personalization of user experience, intuitive and granular control system, which will help to make the experience to be adoptable by most of people.

        <h3>Interviews</h3>
        <p style="font-size: 20px;">The main discovery from interviews was that every interviewed individual has a different set or habits to comfort themselves. But each of them has a repetitive set of habits. Each person were able to describe in details how it is comfortable for them to perform a certain task as well as how and how often they prefer to change position or take breaks. Also, about 80% of individuals could describe what kinds of poses could bring different emotional state for their task. Machine learning could address this issues efficiently and also provide with required support for a person. </p>
        <p style="font-size: 20px;">Body position changes mostly with two main purposes: to prevent tiredness and to change state of mind. One of the common problems is that a person would choose most productive position for the task would get tired and change their pose, which may often influence mood and performance of the task. Solving this problem is, probably, hardest part.  But in this case, system that will be able to learn when individual will get tired and as well correlate is with type of activity may help. Setting up custom presets with easy access to them may also improve experience, and, if these presets will need to be improved posture wise, system will be able to offer required adjustments</p>
        <p style="font-size: 20px;">Less likely people may describe exact position that makes them comfortable or uncomfortable. Nevertheless, they almost always able to describe what makes them uncomfortable in a specific situations or moments. Most of people (about 70%) wish to change not just height or distance between chair and desk, but also an angle. Very often they would want to move the angle of their whole position switching between almost laying down, or straightening up. Together with that, most of them like to keep goods on their desk. When focusing or working, people usually want more support for their body than regular chair provides them and in this case any uncomfort becomes very distracting. </p>

    <section>
        <h3>Contextual Inquiry</h3>
        <p style="font-size: 20px;">Contextual inquiry results support information collected with interviews, but in some cases shows that people would forget about their behavior once they will be in a certain mood or situation. Especially bad habits are usually not noticeable for them.</p>
        <p style="font-size: 20px;">
        About 60% of people move neck back and forth they would change a position of their body, but not neck, which creates various hunching positions. It may indicate that desk, chair and monitor need to move cohesively. If table (with laptop) is smaller and lighter, they may move a table to adjust a distance, but in most of cases furniture does not move. When doing one activity for longer time, about 50% of people begin to do some repetitive movement such as tapping a leg or finger, moving head slightly, especially if listening to a music.
         </p>
        <p style="font-size: 20px;">Position of legs changed very often (approximately every 15 minutes). It includes position of the hips and angle between legs and body. Not a lot of people said that hips get tired, but according to observation it seems to be one of the most tired parts of the body. To fix that, about 80% of people slide their bodies forward, which results in curving a spine. Twisting office chair make posture worse and seems like body gets more tired, because most of people would stretch more after such uncomfortable poses. It tell that chair needs to be more solid support for back and hips while twisting. </p>
        <p style="font-size: 20px;">Positions of body were more similar if a person does a certain kind of activity. It also were noticeable that people usually switching between two positions either timely, or when becoming more or less concentrated. This finding underlines higher importance of two aspects: task or activity, and physical and emotional tiredness, while making further decisions if machine learning implementation.

<section data-transition="slide" id="comparison" style="text-align: left;">
    <section>
        <h3>Comparative Analysis</h3>
        <p style="font-size: 20px;">Results of comparative analysis influenced determination how each part and feature of the system may be controlled. Main aspects of comparison: physical features comparison, machine learning comparison and communication with a user, and overall topic related features like coaching and posture analysis. These three categories will help to solve major issues founded previously.</p>

        <p style="font-size: 20px;">Most of desks are focusing on physical comfort of the person and better support for a person. In those cases control of the system implemented in system itself. Only one compared desk had  implementation of mobile apps and mobile synchronization, but overall implementation does not seem to be very useful because desk itself can perform only one change (height). Visual load of interface of desks is very low, which compensates higher motor load while controlling a system</p>
        <p style="font-size: 20px;">Products used in comparison have both health and comfort as a main goals. As it was found, all of them have different or somehow different solutions and those solutions depend on activities. Smaller devices that focused on coaching and bring more awareness about health will be smaller, portable and additional tools to experience, which are focused mostly on a progress of habits. In most of cases this devices will be connected to a smartphone and will communicate with the user this way. Definitely, granularity of those objects makes people feel free and not distracted by a system. In th these cases, interface has low motor load and higher cognitive or visual load (except nest thermostat has lower cognitive load). All of these systems include AI or algorithm for learning users habits and adopt to it by offering different activities or communicating results to the user.

        <h3>Mental Model</h3>
        <p style="font-size: 20px;">Mental Modeling results helped to brainstorm possible solutions to major problems and figure out features that more or less likely need to be included in the product and how they may work, so user will feel more familiar with control of the system and will have more physical and emotional comfort to manipulate a major settings. Some of the desired features were identified previously from interview and some of them were ideated as a result of collected data.</p>

    <section>
        <h3>Affinity Diagramming</h3>
        <p style="font-size: 20px;">Main findings are that system needs to communicate with the user with two major ways: physical and digital. Physical control of some parts will feel more intuitive and comfortable, but may be not applicable in some positions that user would want to have.Diagram proves an importance of emotional comfort and personalization of the product and adaptability of physical interface to emotional state of the person.
        </p>
                <p style="font-size: 20px;">Affinity diagramming was done to support and organize collected data from interviews and contextual inquiries. Most information that were collected is describing issues and problems that people have using their desks, how they would behave while they doing certain tasks, and what they wish their desk would have. It resulted in three main sections of affinity diagram that were organized in three groups: Needs, Actions, and Response. Response of the system highly connected with both needs and actions that person willing to perform in order to satisfy user expectations and provide with appropriate guidance
        </p>
                <p style="font-size: 20px;">As a second step, each group is broken down on three parts in relation of which goal the user tries to achieve, which helped to see how may it be more efficient for a user to fix certain issues. Affinity diagramming helped to understand major and core needs, aspects and features.

        <h3>Task Analysis and Flowchart</h3>
        <p style="font-size: 20px;">Flowchart and Task Analysis build according to main goals of created user personas and ways how they would prefer to achieve their comfort. This part highly focuses on persona of the user and their experience with a system because it results in certain actions and conscious goals.
        </p>
           <p style="font-size: 20px;">Analysis of onboarding were focused on how to make a user interested right away. Instead of describing experience of the physical device, that choice was to demonstrate what system can do first. Later on in the process, system will recognize if user familiar with certain functionality or not. Because of the audience of users very broad, it is hard to know what user will want to do first. Instead of forcing learning on user, system will learn from the user and response certain way.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;">System will have to act differently depending on the amount of information it has about user in order to not force unnecessary steps for experienced users, and do not miss any parts for those, who is new to the experience</p>

        <h3>Journey Mapping</h3>
        <p style="font-size: 20px;">Main findings after journey mapping method helped to understand what are possible ways user can interact with all parts of the interface: each journey more likely should be shorter and system will ask for a confirmation before making a move, that were controlled with digital interface. Additionally, journey maps determined aspects of each path that are necessarily for a successful goal achievement and appropriate understanding. Nevertheless, As were found in task analysis earlier, those paths will vary depending on users level of proficiency with this system.

    <section>
        <h3>Design Studio</h3>
        <p style="font-size: 20px;">In design studio process were explored an aspect of possible digital control over the desk. There were no specifications on layout or placement of control system. In results this process opened an idea of granularity of controls:  fast buttons that would be located on different parts of desk/chair. After this process new features, that can majorly influence further design decisions, may be added: fast buttons, favorites, control over accessories on a table, layout types, personal recognition.
Personal recognition feature has a large importance for the system, because the experience, including learning from the user, personalized. Fast buttons or favorites as well would improve simplicity and increase comfortability. Besides, fast buttons in combination with granularity of interface can help intuitive interaction with a desk and chair that closer to usual physical control that person already familiar with.

    <h3>Storyboarding</h3>
<p style="font-size: 20px;">Main decisions that were made as a result of storyboarding was a further simplification of motor controls. The main focus of exploration in this process was to explore and explain possible desk and chair features. They may not be included in a prototype of a digital controls, but have very important part in user experience and usability.
These features also can play major role in achieving a goal of the system such as chair manipulation for body support, automatic adjustment of distance and angle between eyes and screen when other parts of desk moved; Or they can be something that will make experience more comfortable, for instance, turning monitor into a note board, or expanding the desk and allowing multiple height and angles for it.</p>

    <ul class="ul">
        <li style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">Make sure that unhappy path is also included. Allowing a person to say no would bring more information about this user and in future eliminate a possibility of offering something that user dislikes.
        </li>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">Keep tasks shorter (when user needs to use a desk, they need to use a desk for something.</li>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">Controls do not need to be in a lot of places: hotkeys bar can be right where screen is</li>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">System always should have a response/confirmation before physical movement, but it is not necessary to include to much confirmation messages when changes shown graphically. </li>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">Positions not necessarily should be for specific activities, but also for conditions/moods. For instance: relax, concentrate, rest and etc.</li>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">The most confusing part was a language. It is hard to distinct between selecting, setting up, choosing and etc.

        <li style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">“It does not have to tell me that new position added to favorites or that alert is set. Color changes and it is understandable.”  ⇒ some unnecessary messages were eliminated =>
        “ I like how this complicated system is easy to control because all tasks are short.”
        </li>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">“I feel like alerts or pop ups will be either distracting or ignored” ⇒ Add an option to turn off notifications.</li>
